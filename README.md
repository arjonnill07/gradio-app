## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Local Setup

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   A Google account and a **YouTube Data API v3 key**.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjonnill07/gradio-app.git
cd gradio-app
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
This keeps your project dependencies isolated.
code
Bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
The project includes a requirements.txt file to install all necessary libraries.
code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
The YouTube analysis module requires an API key. It's best practice to set this as an environment variable rather than hardcoding it.

-   **Get your API Key**: Follow the instructions from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to enable the "YouTube Data API v3" and create an API key.
-   **Set the Environment Variable**:
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

    # For Windows
    set YOUTUBE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    The application will automatically detect and use this key.

### 5. Download the Bengali Font
For the word clouds and plots to render Bengali text correctly, you need the `NotoSansBengali-Regular.ttf` font.
-   Download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+Bengali).
-   Place the `.ttf` file in the root directory of the project.

### 6. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860).
